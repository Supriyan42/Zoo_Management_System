# Zoo_Management_System
Zoo Management System is a web-based technology which manages peoples, animals details and provides ticket to the person who comes to visits in zoo with his/her family. This web application provides a way to effectively control record & track the people who visit to zoo.

Zoos traditionally rely on manual record-keeping, which can be time-consuming, error-prone, and difficult to manage as the number of animals and visitors grows. The Zoo Management System addresses these issues by providing a centralized platform where authorized personnel can add, view, update, and delete records easily through a user-friendly web interface.

The backend is powered by MySQL, which stores all the essential data in a structured format. PHP serves as the server-side scripting language that communicates between the user interface and the database. Combined with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end, this system offers a complete solution for efficient zoo administration.
